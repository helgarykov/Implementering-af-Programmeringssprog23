Todo for resubmission:
  - Fix task 1
  - Fix task 2
  - Fix task 3

General comments:

Task 1:
You are forgetting to add/remove UV's in some cases.
Notably 1, 5, 9, 10, 11

This probably messes with your elim in 10. (And OE in 10 and 11)

Task 2:
b. 'b' should still be in in[9] in first iteration.
   (And everything before that will change a bit because of this)
c. Slightly changed by fault in b

Rest is correct.

Task 3:
The first part of the regex should be parsed as ((a*b)|a)*, 
otherwise this would be correct.

Task 4:
Correct.
