Todo for resubmission:
  - Fix task 1
  - Fix task 2
  
General comments:
I find the two-colum approach very hard to read (especially when the seperator is inconsistent)

Task 1:
I do not see how you got the IL code by following the translation table. Make sure not to optimize it in any way.
The machine code seems to be a correct translation of the IL.

Task 2:
Consider reversing the order of rules in the table, as the first rule overshadows the last two.
In general these patterns should be able to be written in a shorter way and without branching.
The second rule should make w the logical opposite of z (if z is 0 then w is set to 1, otherwise its set to 0)

Task 3:
a. You are allocating too much space, each element is only a single byte in this case.
b. Correct translation of C code in a.
