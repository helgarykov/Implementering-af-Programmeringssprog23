# Overall

You should not submit the entire Fasto compiler in future submissions.
Todo for resubmission:
  - Fix max/argmax

# Task 1

Ok.

# Task 2

Impressive tail-recursive implementation of ranges! 
It is a valid thing to have mentioned when discussing performance.

max/argmax should give an error when the upper bound is lower than the lower bound.
  fx 'max x=6 to 5 of x+x'

# Task 3

Ok. (Your error reporting has sligthly incorrect capitalizaion which is messing with our tests)
